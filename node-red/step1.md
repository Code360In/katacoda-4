This is a playground environment for the Node-RED flow editor.

After the message, "Connecting to Port 1880" is displayed for about 40 seconds, your browser will automatically load Node-RED flow editor.
On the playground, you can install nodes, develop your flow, and deploy the flow.
Because it is a temporary environment on Katacoda, the Node-RED instance will be removed automatically after about 30 minutes.
